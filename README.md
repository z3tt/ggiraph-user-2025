# Plot Twist: Adding Interactivity to the Elegance of ggplot2 with ggiraph

### Talk for [useR 2025](https://user2025.r-project.org/) by [CÃ©dric Scherer](https://www.cedricscherer.com/) and [Tanya Shapiro](www.indievisual.tech)

One of the most common critiques of ggplot2 is its lack of built-in interactivity. While static plots are powerful for storytelling, interactive visualizations can enhance exploration, engagement, and accessibility. The ggiraph package finally provides a seamless way to add interactivity to ggplot2â€”enabling hover effects, tooltips, and clickable elementsâ€”while preserving the familiar layered approach and custom theming.

In this talk, Tanya Shapiro and CÃ©dric Scherer will demonstrate why ggiraph stands out among other solutions, such as plotly, and how it integrates effortlessly with ggplot2 and its extension ecosystem. Weâ€™ll walk through real-world examples, explore its key functionalities, and share practical tips for creating engaging and well-designed interactive visualizations with ggiraph.

Whether you're looking to make your research more engaging, enhance dashboards, or create interactive reports, this talk will provide a solid foundation for elevating your data storytelling with interactive visualizations.
